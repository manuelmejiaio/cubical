                I’ve found ways to ensure small and medium size companies get as well planned and robust as big firms by merging the best of engineering and statistics with business knowledge. I’m an Industrial and Entrepreneurial Engineer with a Master in Business Administration. I started my career working on continuous improvement projects; applying engineering best practices to day to day business problems. Then, I turned my eyes to business and as of today, I have 5 years working mainly on Financial and strategic planning and analysis for businesses.

                After working in big companies, and small-medium size companies, I noticed that there were some key differences between them in terms of decision making and implementation. Besides having more resources, big companies are devoted to planning and standardizing. They have teams with the mere objectives of supply chain planning, revenue management, financial planning, etc. Furthermore, they even have time and resources to proactively identify skills that they will need for the future and train their teams accordingly. In “already big” companies, after the implementation of a great plan, usually there is another team (insiders or consultants) that study the methodology used, make it leaner, and standardize it. This closes gaps for unqualified products/services, and diminishes the risk of growing with operational deficiencies.

                In contrast, small-medium size companies are a chaos full of creativity and passion. Usually owners and managers work side by side to make the most out of the resources they have created so far. Some of them understand the importance of planning and standardizing but, often business owners think this is a luxury of big companies and there is not enough time to sit down and tackle organizational tasks because other vital areas of the business may suffer if they are not 100% involved. Others either pay for or invest a lot of time in planning the next product, project, or year, but fail at following up on the goals and milestones they defined.

                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
                Why do we use it?
                It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
